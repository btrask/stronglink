C Programming Substance Guidelines
==================================

**AKA Everything You Need to Know to Write Good C Code**  
**AKA The StrongLink Code Contribution Guidelines**

This document is intended to provide _substance_ guidelines, as opposed to _style_ guidelines frequently proposed and debated elsewhere. Every guideline herein should have some intuitive (if not provable) rationale for how it improves code quality (mainly by making code less error-prone or more secure). Conversely, I will not tell you where to put your braces.

These techniques are intended to be widely applicable, but probably aren't relevant to game engines (where security basically doesn't matter) or hard real-time/safety-critical control software (where you might ban all dynamic allocation and unverifiable loop bounds...).

This article is written for experienced programmers, although not necessarily experienced in C. Familiarity with C is assumed. This article is _not_ about C++ (which I'm not at all qualified to write about).

If you're interested in learning C, Zed Shaw's [Learn C the Hard Way](http://c.learncodethehardway.org/book/) is probably very good, although I've only read a few parts.

This document is mainly about avoiding problems specific to the C programming language. Language-specific bugs are only a portion of the whole picture:

- Bugs in usage: careless use, social engineering...
- Bugs in deployment: misconfiguration, difficulty upgrading...
- Bugs in distribution: insecure channels, key management...
- Bugs in development - language-agnostic: databases, networking...
- Bugs in development - language-specific (**you are here**)
- Bugs in design: bad balance of tradeoffs...
- Bugs in architecture: insufficient isolation, big ball of mud...
- Bugs in requirements: not considering security a priority, over-complexity...

That said, I don't want to under-represent the importance of these bugs. Misuse-of-language bugs probably accounts for (pulling a number of out my hat) close to half of all software vulnerabilities, and C specifically has a lot of ways to be misused.

_Disclaimer: I didn't invent almost any of these techniques, although I independently rediscovered several of them._

_Disclaimer: This only explains how to program, not what to program or why._

_Disclaimer: This article is a work in progress. Like a list on Wikipedia, it may never be complete._

- General
	- Older C isn't better when it comes to security and avoiding bugs
		- K&R C is much beloved, but that innocent era is gone
		- We can't afford to [fight each other](http://zedshaw.com/2015/01/04/admitting-defeat-on-kr-in-lcthw/), or [C will](http://techcrunch.com/2015/05/02/and-c-plus-plus-too/) really [die](http://trevorjim.com/lets-sunset-c-c++/)
	- Things that are large and frequently changing will NEVER be secure
		- Doesn't matter what language they're in
		- The Linux kernel will never be secure, but thankfully you can just run it under a hypervisor
			- Unfortunately most hypervisors are ever-expanding as well...
	- Larger scales (e.g. project size) requires heavier duty techniques
		- I think it's possible to write secure programs in C up to maybe 25-50KLOC using these guidelines
			- For reference, the ext3 file system was 28KLOC (ext4 is 60) [[cite]](https://lwn.net/Articles/651645/)
		- The problem domain must be "well defined," meaning the code is not constantly changing
		- Larger projects get disproportionately hard to audit, and audits must keep up with the pace of changes
		- I'm skeptical whether something like a web browser can ever be secure, but I completely acknowledge that Rust is the only hope for it
		- If you can keep your project small, I think C can be used effectively
		- For the record, StrongLink is currently 10KLOC including some parts that could be broken off into separate libraries
	- If you care about security, the best thing you can do is keep the project small
		- I don't think there is actually much relation between programming language and code size
		- A small code size should be a badge of honor ("lines spent")
		- It's harder to write less code than more
- Error handling
	- Do it, always, even in sample code
		- Error handling is all programming is
			- The problem is an error and your program is the handler
		- Handle errors like everyone is watching
	- Keep error checks short so they are less painful to read/write
		- Single line if possible: `if(rc < 0) return rc;`
		- When several steps are needed use `rc = rc < 0 ? rc : expr;`
		- If you're writing a web server, you should be able to use `return 404;`
		- Anything longer is suffering, even `return HTTP(404);`
	- Checks should be as simple as possible but no simpler
		- Macros can help, but don't abuse them
		- Try to keep control flow (`goto`/`return`) out of macros
			- It can be done quite compactly inline
	- Translate codes from meaningful to callee to meaningful to caller
		- Single line if possible: `if(X == rc) return Y;`
		- Most of the time this shouldn't be necessary
	- Try not to mix error code sets within a single function or API
		- Convert all error types into one as early as possible
		- Don't use libraries that have bad error handling
			- Or worst case, wrap them
	- Functions should have a policy of either reporting or returning errors
		- Low level reusable functions should only return them
		- High level app-specific functions can report them
			- Don't go too crazy, just log to `stderr`
			- Or show them to the user, depending
- Memory management
	- Freeing
		- Immediately clear pointers after freeing
			- E.g. `free(x); x = NULL;`
			- Define a macro like `FREE(&x)` to do this for you
			- Prevents use-after-free and double free
			- If you can't clear a pointer marked `const`, you don't own it
		- Assert that buffers are entirely zeroed before freeing
			- Don't just `memset` to 0, `FREE`/clear each field individually
			- Catches memory leaks
			- You can skip this for known safe buffers (like strings)
		- When you free a sensitive buffer, use `explicit_bzero()` first
		- When you move a pointer from one variable to another, null out the old one
			- E.g. `x = y; y = NULL;`
			- Then you can unconditionally free `y` without problem
		- It would be nice to have a compiler feature to assert that all stack variables are zeroed when they go out of scope
	- Allocation
		- Use `calloc` instead of `malloc`
		- Be careful when using `reallocarray`
			- You should generally track used and unused space in dynamic arrays, so uninitialized memory shouldn't be a problem there
		- Don't write custom allocators
			- Even simple bump allocators, or whatever
			- Custom allocation defeats memory safety in every language
			- Unfortunately the ease of custom allocation is a big benefit of C
	- Lifespans
		- Use `const` to indicate and enforce ownership
			- `X *const` can't be null'd so it can't be freed
			- `X const *` doesn't coerce to `void *` so it can't be freed either
		- Have a single owner and know what it is
			- Have related objects share an owner to simplify lifespans and cleanup
		- Use reference counting when necessary (last resort)
			- Avoid cycles
			- Parent pointers should be weak (non-owning)
				- Avoid them entirely when possible
		- Use `get`/`init` or `create`/`copy`/`alloc` in function names to indicate ownership versus borrowing for return values
	- Stack size
		- Limit recursion
		- Use loops instead of relying on TCO (personal preference)
			- Don't be fancy
		- Don't declare large arrays on the stack
		- Always declare the worst case size instead of using `alloca(3)`
		- Use nested local scopes when necessary
	- Cleanup in case of errors
		- C's biggest weakness
			- But other languages don't even allow allocations to fail
			- C error handling is hard but that's because it's trying
		- Limited options in C (in order of preference)
			1. Use stack allocation so no cleanup is needed
			2. Use `goto` (best general purpose option)
			3. Do allocations in a parent function and pass them in
			4. Use separate functions so cleanup stays simple
			5. Tie many allocations together into a single object
			6. Combine error handlers after several smaller operations
			7. Free temporary buffers ASAP so future errors can ignore them
		- Note: all of these options are situational and require consideration
		- Also consider using an assertion or abort() on failure
			- `assert(x)` is basically equivalent to Rust's `x.unwrap()`
	- Make allocations as static as possible
		- Just allocate the maximum always
	- A buffer overflow on the stack is worse than one elsewhere
		- [Some people will say](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=9202212) you should avoid reading untrusted data into stack-allocated buffers
		- I think that's a bridge too far
		- Safe-Stack, Code-Pointer Integrity, and other techniques will help (if you can use them)
- General errors
	- Off-by-one errors
		- Know the difference between indexes and counts
		- Consider what will happen in the case of zero or one items
		- Write loops in a few consistent patterns
	- Floating point
		- Don't use floats, aside from user input and output (including graphics)
			- Don't use floats for money, duh
		- Don't compare floats using strict equality
		- Don't divide by zero
		- NaN
			- Don't use floats and you'll never run into it...
	- Assertions
		- Don't do anything with side effects in assertion statements
			- If you're still worried, define `assert(x)` to `(void)x` so side effects get preserved
		- Don't assert things that aren't obviously invariants
		- Consider shipping with assertions on
		- Include descriptive strings like `assert(cond && "msg")`
			- Or `assert(!"msg")`
		- Use an assertion macro that accepts a format string
			- Have the assertion print the value of what it's checking
			- `assertf(rc >= 0, "Example error: %s", my_strerror(rc));`
	- Line-based diff bugs ("goto fail")
		- Put one-statement conditionals on the same line as the condition
			- `if(rc < 0) goto fail;`
			- Copy and paste or diff errors are less dangerous and more obvious
			- If it doesn't fit on one line, put it in braces
			- Be very careful about adding a second statement on the same line (with braces obviously)
				- I do this sometimes but I know it's bad practice
				- It'd be nice to have a compiler warning for statements that look like they're in a conditional but aren't
		- Put a comma after the last element in arrays (if one element per line)
		- Put logical units on the same line
			- Otherwise wrap them in parentheses or braces
	- Integer overflow/underflow
		- Use `calloc`/`reallocarray` (from OpenBSD) instead of `malloc`/`realloc`
		- Use overflow-checking compiler intrinsics
		- Respect the integer types used by each API (`int`, `size_t`, `ssize_t`...)
		- Use `!!` when converting to `bool`
	- Macros
		- Wrap variable expansions in parentheses
		- Wrap multiple statements in `do {} while(0)` or `({})`
			- Do not be afraid of trivial, widely supported compiler extensions
		- Prefix scoped variable names with underscores to prevent shadowing
			- Double underscore is reserved for the implementation, but you have my permission to use it judiciously
			- If you're worried, come up with your own prefix like `xx__something`
		- Use local variables to avoid evaluating expressions multiple times
			- And use `__typeof__(var)` on compilers that support it
	- Never explicitly compare booleans to true or false
		- False is unnecessary and true is incorrect
	- Use the style of expression to convey the type of check being done
		- Don't use `!strcmp()`, compare with zero instead
	- Use `{}` instead of `;` for empty statements
		- Harder to miss
- Strings
	- Format strings
		- Always use string literals to specify format strings
		- Use `"%s"` instead of directly passing string variables
		- Know which APIs expect format strings
			- Passing a dynamic string where a format string was expected is a security vulnerability
			- Name functions taking format strings ending in "f"
	- `scanf(3)`
		- Pre-initialize all outputs
		- Always specify string widths
		- Be careful about locales
		- Sometimes it's easiest to check the scanned length with `%n` (takes `int *`)
	- String functions
		- Use `strlcpy` and `strlcat` from OpenBSD
		- Use `snprintf(3)` instead of `sprintf(3)` (it takes an output length)
		- Use `strdup(3)`
	- Define string length constants as `(X+1)` to indicate nul termination
		- If you're using UTF-8 (which you should be), remember the length is bytes, not characters
	- Use `signed char` for strings and `unsigned char` for buffers
		- `typedef unsigned char byte_t;`
		- Compiler warnings will catch accidental conversions
	- Have a string type for borrowed strings
		- I like `typedef char const *strarg_t;`
		- Another name that has been suggested is `borrowedstr_t`
		- This isn't a style guide so the name is up to you
	- Parsing
		- I have no idea how to hand-parse strings in an easy, safe and efficient manner
		- I don't want machine-generated code
		- Suggestions welcome
- Threading
	- Shared resources
		- Know when to use locks, conditions and semaphores
			- They should come in pairs
		- Declare the mutex together with the variables it protects
		- Generally avoid read-write locks
			- If you need a read-write lock, you need a better data structure
		- Know when `volatile` or atomics are necessary and then use locks instead
			- Depends on what kind of code you're writing, of course
	- Threading really deserves a whole separate article
		- Teaser: asynchronous callbacks are threads and queues are locks
- File system
	- `fsync` (including on directories after renaming contents)
	- Atomic operations (`rename`, `link`, `unlink`...)
	- Specify permissions on `open(2)` to avoid race conditions
	- Use `O_CREAT | O_EXCL`
	- Short `read`s and `write`s
		- Handle `EINTR`
- Creating good APIs
	- [Some say](http://mollyrocket.com/jacs/jacs_0004_0008.html) it's the hardest skill in programming
	- Empathize with the person who has to use your API
	- Write sample code using your API before you define it
	- Don't hide power or assume you know better than your user
	- Public APIs should have some sort of prefix or namespace
	- Use error codes, not strings
		- LevelDB, what were you thinking...?
- Modularity
	- Code duplication
		- Plugins should have the minimum boilerplate possible
			- The more plugins you have, the less duplication you can afford
			- Abuse preprocessor macros if you have to?
		- [Redundancy vs dependencies: which is worse?](http://yosefk.com/blog/redundancy-vs-dependencies-which-is-worse.html)
	- Code that changes together should be grouped together
	- Code should be factored so that changes don't ripple throughout the codebase
	- Files are C's primary namespaces
		- Declare file-local variables and functions as `static`
- Testing
	- Tools
		- Your best tool is the compiler
			- Read the list of available compiler warnings
		- Static analyzers (but compiler warnings are better)
		- Sanitizers and runtime checkers (e.g. Valgrind)
		- Fuzzers (e.g. [american fuzzy lop](http://lcamtuf.coredump.cx/afl/))
	- No one can physically see what a computer is doing, so we need tools to visualize it for us
		- A lot of these tools don't exist yet, in any language
		- Unfortunately we need them to be universal and open source, so there isn't much money in it
		- For niche cases you will need to write your own tools anyway
	- Unit testing
		- At least do end-to-end testing for stable APIs you expect other people to use
	- Manual testing
		- There is no substitute for manual testing
		- Test how things break, not just how they work
	- Debug with the same optimization mode as release (e.g. `-g -O2`)
		- Turn it down when necessary for the debugger
- Header files
	- Use them properly for keeping your public and private interfaces separate
		- Aside: any language that uses keywords like `public` and `private` to determine visibility instead of placement/scoping is bad
	- You should probably have one header for a collection of `.c` files
		- Not one header per `.c`
	- `static` functions in headers are always hacks
		- Not all hacks are bad, just keep it in mind
- Pointers
	- Use `struct thing thingptr[1];` to get pointers with inline storage
		- Lets you avoid `.` or excessive use of `&`
		- You should pretty much always use `->` instead of `.`
		- Most useful in structs, also sometimes useful on the stack
		- I think this is the most important trick for making C code beautiful
	- Use `&x[5]` instead of `x+5` when you need the address of an array element
		- It's just more explicit
	- Use `x[0]` to avoid `(*x)`, sometimes?
		- Both are bad though
		- If you have an "OO" API, define a macro like `MSG(obj, func, arg)`
			- Try to avoid APIs like that though
	- Use `const` in function signatures to communicate use of pointer args
		- Declare the top pointer `const` to make it clear what can change
			- E.g. `X **const asdf`
		- It helps, despite the fact that the top `const` isn't actually part of the signature
	- Use in-out args for recursion, especially tree walking
	- Brain teaser: what's the ideal pointer size?
- Naming conventions
	- Different conventions from different libraries is not a bad thing
		- When wrapping/extending a library, keep its conventions
		- It'll keep you from wrapping things just to make them more familiar
	- Maintain a distinction between low level and high level interfaces
		- Or between public and private interfaces
		- An example of this is SQLite
	- It's nice if related names are the same length
		- E.g. `next` and `prev`, `src` and `dst`
		- Preserve and enhance symmetry
		- In a comparator callback, `a` and `b` are perfectly suitable
	- Simplify complex expressions with named local variables
		- And declare them `const`
		- Write code in "single static assignment" form
	- I don't care if you use `camelCase`, `under_scores` or whatever
- Avoid conspicuous complexity
	- Use post-increment over pre-increment unless it matters
	- Yoda conditions...? Iffy... (I'm used to them now...)
		- It's better to catch accidental assignment with compiler warnings
		- There's still an argument for putting the shorter term first
	- Complicated solutions better solve very important problems
	- Go out of your way to keep common things simple (e.g. error handling)
		- Especially things you want to encourage (e.g. error handling)
	- Preserve, create and exploit symmetry
		- E.g. use vectors (in the physics sense) instead of enums for directions
	- Resist the "nesting instinct"
		- You are a visitor here (on the user's computer... and in life?)
- Performance
	- Choosing good optimizations and avoiding bad ones is the core of programming
		- Know when an optimization is too complicated to be worth it
		- If it's really necessary, find a simpler way
		- 20% of the optimizations make 80% of the difference
	- Do not worry about 1% speedups
		- SQLite has gotten significantly faster from lots of ~1% boosts
			- ...And it'll never be as fast as MDB
	- Almost never use fancy data structures
		- Funny how C is so fast without built in hash tables or anything else
		- Most of the time it doesn't matter and the overhead isn't worth it
		- [Rob Pike: "Fancy algorithms are slow when _n_ is small, and _n_ is usually small."](https://www.lysator.liu.se/c/pikestyle.html)
		- Sometimes it does and gets inconvenient, though...
	- Study data-oriented design
		- The appropriate memory representation depends on the access patterns
		- Random Access Memory doesn't exist
		- When performance matters, linked lists are really bad
	- The `restrict` keyword should be used rarely if ever
	- The `inline` keyword should be used rarely if ever
		- Compilers basically ignore it, for good reason
		- If function call overhead is your bottleneck, you've probably done something wrong
		- Don't deal with audio one sample at a time
		- Don't deal with buffers one byte at a time
			- Ask Linus Torvalds... Or Kay Sievers
				- Warning: [strong language](http://lkml.iu.edu/hypermail/linux/kernel/1207.0/02973.html)
		- While we're at it, don't deal with thread pools one syscall at a time
- Build system (not a thorough analysis)
	- Use `-Wall -Wextra -Werror`
		- But turn off errors you don't care about instead of cluttering your code
			- `-Wno-unused`
		- If you turn off a warning, document why
			- It will be the only thing keeping your head attached when that warning would've caught a critical vulnerability
	- Use `-Wwrite-strings`
		- Makes string literals `const`
		- Forces you to use `const` correctly almost everywhere
			- More importantly, prevents you from freeing constant strings
	- I wish we had more good compiler warnings
- Study great real-world C projects
	- [SQLite](https://sqlite.org/) (the gold standard for any codebase in any language)
	- [PostgreSQL](http://www.postgresql.org/) (although I haven't personally looked at it)
	- [MDB](http://symas.com/mdb/) (not always perfect but very efficiently written)
	- Code from [OpenBSD](http://www.openbsd.org/) (it doesn't look special, it's just simple and error-free)
	- [Apple's CoreFoundation API](https://developer.apple.com/library/prerelease/mac/documentation/CoreFoundation/Reference/CoreFoundation_Collection/) (my model for modern object-oriented C code)

See, that wasn't so hard, was it?

Why is this list so long and complicated?
-----------------------------------------

Optimization always causes problems, regardless of what you're optimizing for. Look at the failures of capitalism. When you try to write efficient, security-critical code in C, you are serving two masters: security and performance. Obviously, serving one master is easier.

It's worth pointing out that while there is a lot of messy garbage written in C, some of the [most secure](http://cr.yp.to/qmail/qmailsec-20071101.pdf) software [of all time](https://sel4.systems/) is written in it too.

Incidentally, these examples sit at opposite ends of the spectrum: qmail was written by a single genius who basically kept it all in his head; seL4 was written using formal methods. Both techniques constrain the size and change rate of projects, which I believe is the true key to security.

Real-world code
---------------

I follow these techniques as much as possible in my project [StrongLink](https://github.com/btrask/stronglink/). You can read the code to see these principles applied in the real world. Nothing is perfect, so bug reports are welcome.

Also check the [Security Information page](https://github.com/btrask/stronglink/blob/master/SECURITY.md).
